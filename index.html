                        1. Cry Baby (2015)
                        This is Melanie's debut studio album, which introduced the world to the character "Cry Baby," a fictional and vulnerable version of Melanie herself.

                        <ul>
                            <li>Concept: The album follows the life of a young girl named Cry Baby. It uses childhood metaphors (toys, bottles, playgrounds) to tell stories about dark, adult themes like family dysfunction, toxic relationships, and self-image.</li>

                        2. K-12 (2019)
                        The second album continues the story of Cry Baby as she grows up and enters the school system. This project was released alongside a full-length musical film written and directed by Melanie.

                        3. Portals (2023)
                        The final chapter of the trilogy. In this era, the "Cry Baby" character dies and is reborn as a pink-skinned, four-eyed fairy creature in a mystical forest.
                        Release Date: March 31, 2023.
                        <ul>

                        1. Dollhouse EP (2014)
                        This was Melanie's debut release after her appearance on The Voice. It set the foundation for the "Cry Baby" universe.
                        Release Date: May 19, 2014.
                        The Concept: It introduced the "creepy-cute" aesthetic, using childhood imagery to describe dysfunctional family life and heartbreak.
                        <h4>Tracklist:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Dollhouse (The signature song about a family that seems perfect but is falling apart).</li>
                            <li>Carousel (About a circular, never-ending toxic romance).</li>
                            <li>Dead To Me (A darker track about "killing off" the memory of an ex).</li>
                            <li>Bittersweet Tragedy (Comparing a relationship to the temporary sweetness of candy).</li>
                        </ul>
                        Fun Fact: This EP was largely produced by the hip-hop duo Kinetics & One Love, which is why it has such a strong rhythmic beat compared to traditional pop.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. Cry Baby's Extra Clutter EP (2016)
                        This EP was released as a physical vinyl exclusive (and later digital) to collect the "missing pieces" of the Cry Baby era.
                        Release Date: November 25, 2016.
                        The Concept: It contains the three bonus tracks from the Cry Baby Deluxe album, plus her standalone holiday single.
                        <h4>Tracklist:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Play Date (A song about unrequited feelings that became a massive viral hit on TikTok years later).</li>
                            <li>Teddy Bear (About a partner who goes from sweet to violent).</li>
                            <li>Cake (Using baking metaphors to talk about being used for one's body).</li>
                            <li>Gingerbread Man (A holiday-themed track about looking for a partner who is "sweet" but strong).</li>
                        </ul>
                        Fun Fact: This EP was originally an Urban Outfitters exclusive vinyl, making it a rare collector's item for many years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. After School EP (2020)
                        This EP serves as the Deluxe version of the K-12 album. It is considered one of her most mature and lyrically complex works.
                        Release Date: September 25, 2020.
                        The Concept: While it still uses school-related titles, Melanie stated that these songs are more personal to her own life rather than just being about the character "Cry Baby." It explores themes of growth, the music industry, and spirituality.
                        <h4>Tracklist:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Notebook (A "breakup" song about setting boundaries).</li>
                            <li>Test Me (A fan-favorite about how life's challenges are better teachers than school).</li>
                            <li>Brain & Heart (Discussing the need for balance between logic and emotion).</li>
                            <li>Numbers (A critique of the music industry treating artists like products).</li>
                            <li>Glued (About the struggle of being either too attached or too detached).</li>
                            <li>Field Trip (A very personal song about her personality and her heritage).</li>
                            <li>The Bakery (About her real-life experience working at a bakery before she was famous).</li>
                        </ul>
                        Fun Fact: The song "The Bakery" comes with a music video where Melanie is literally "kneaded" and "baked" like dough, showcasing her love for surrealist visuals.

                        1. Gingerbread Man (2015)
                        Originally released as a gift to her fans for the holidays, this song eventually became part of the Cry Baby’s Extra Clutter EP.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Release Date: December 23, 2015.</li>
                            <li>The Concept: Using her signature food metaphors, Melanie describes her search for a "sweet" partner who is actually "tough" and won't crumble under pressure. It fits perfectly with the "creepy-childhood" aesthetic of the Cry Baby era.</li>
                            <li>Fun Fact: Melanie released this song for free on SoundCloud as a Christmas present before it was ever available on major streaming platforms.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. Piggyback (2017)
                        This is perhaps Melanie's most personal and raw song, released during a very difficult time in her personal life and career.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Release Date: December 22, 2017.</li>
                            <li>The Concept: The lyrics tell the story of her journey to fame—from her childhood to The Voice and beyond. It addresses "fake friends" and people who tried to take advantage of her success (or "piggyback" off her). It is a song about resilience and finding her own strength.</li>
                            <li>Musical Style: It has a stripped-back, electronic beat that feels more like a diary entry than a polished pop song.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                        3. Copy Cat (feat. Tierra Whack) (2020)
                        This song was released shortly before the After School EP and features the rapper Tierra Whack, making it Melanie's first official collaboration with another artist on a single.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Release Date: February 10, 2020.</li>
                            <li>The Concept: As the title suggests, the song is about people who lack their own identity and try to steal or "copy" Melanie’s unique style and creative ideas. It explores the frustration of being an original artist in a world of imitators.</li>
                            <li>Fun Fact: This was a very unexpected collaboration, but fans loved it because both Melanie and Tierra Whack are known for their highly surreal and avant-garde visual styles.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                        3. Fire Drill (2020)
                        This track was originally heard during the end credits of the K-12 film. Due to massive fan demand, she released the full version as a single.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Release Date: June 26, 2020.</li>
                            <li>The Concept: The song is a social critique. It uses the metaphor of a school "fire drill" to talk about how people in society are obsessed with attention, social media validation, and "fake" drama. Melanie urges listeners to focus on what is real rather than the "fire" (chaos) created by the internet.</li>
                            <li>Key Lyric: "I'm not the government, I'm not the fucked up men who are running it / I'm just a girl who's trying to find a way to get out of it."</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    What inspired Melanie Martinez to create the "Cry Baby" character and album?
                </summary>
                <p>
                    Melanie Martinez created the "Cry Baby" character as a way to explore and express her own vulnerabilities and experiences through a fictional persona. The album uses childhood metaphors to address complex themes such as family issues, self-image, and toxic relationships.

                    How does the "K-12" album differ from "Cry Baby" in terms of themes and concepts?
                </summary>
                <p>
                    "K-12" continues the story of Cry Baby as she navigates the school system, addressing social issues like bullying, sexism, and eating disorders. Unlike "Cry Baby," which focuses on personal struggles, "K-12" serves as a broader social commentary on the pressures faced by students in educational settings.
